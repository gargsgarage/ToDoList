Designed and implemented a Java-based full-stack Todo List application, using Gradle for build and dependency management and Javaâ€™s HttpServer to handle HTTP requests and RESTful APIs. Structured the application with a Model-View-Controller architecture, connecting it to a PostgreSQL database via JDBC for secure data management and retrieval. Deployed the application and database on an AWS EC2 instance, configuring the server for global accessibility.
